## 1. Project 1 - myWebsite<a name = "pro1"></a>

This is project that is compulsory for task 5:
1. To re-use a static website from a previous task.
2. Deploy it to GitHub to see if it works.

The website came from one of my previous tasks. The folder myWebsite only has the homepage and library of said task. The idea behind the task was to create a online bookstore. If the user seeks to access the Library they are required to sign up or sign in to access the Libray. The blog was available to all.

## 2. Project 2 - CV<a name = "pro2"></a>

This project was based on a previous task, to create a CV using a webpage. Instead of creating a new webpage I've re-used the same old program, just fixed it.
