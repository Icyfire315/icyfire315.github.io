## 1. Project 1<a name = "pro1"></a>

This is a personal project, for the following reason:
1. To recap what I've learnt
2. Cause I'm bored and have nothing better to do.

The main idea of this project to help an imaginary bakery create a platform to sell their baked goods. They are relativey new to the market and need help creating a desktop app and a website. They would also like a database to store information about current, done, pending, and cancelled orders.

To meet such requirements, the project has been split into four phases. The phases are as follows:
* The Overview
* The Desktop Application
* Adding the database to the application
* Creating the Website

## 2. Project 2<a name = "pro2"></a>

The repositories, except for the overview, will have two or more branches to help finalise the project. The main will be used for confirmed version of the project, the other branches will be used to makes changes, prevent accidental pushes to the main branch etc,.
