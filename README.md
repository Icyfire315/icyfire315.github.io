# Task 5 - Deployment
<sub>Assignment for bootcamp.</sub>
   
## Project 1 - myWebsite

This is project that is compulsory for task 5:
1. To re-use a static website from a previous task.
2. Deploy it to GitHub to see if it works.

The website came from one of my previous tasks. The folder myWebsite only has the homepage and library of said task. The idea behind the task was to create a online bookstore.
